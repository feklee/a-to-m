Example of a simple sequencer. Connect atoms, then push two buttons
simultaneously on the first atom to send a pulse through the network.
It propagates at a rate of 240 beats per atom. Each atom that is
pulsed, plays a note. Configure the note by pushing the buttons on an
atom.

Buttons:

  * Release multiple: Create a pulse propagating through the network.
  
  * Button 1: Increase note.

  * Button 2: Change duration.
  
  * Button 3: Decrease note.
  
  * Button 4: Change waveform.
